= Delete an OpenSearch service

If you do not need an OpenSearch service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete exoscaleopensearches.exoscale.appcat.vshn.io opensearch-instance
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `ExoscaleOpenSearch` object from the cluster, it will be deleted together with all of its data!
