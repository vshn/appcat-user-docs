== Get information about your new OpenSearch instance

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get exoscaleopensearches.exoscale.appcat.vshn.io

test1   True     True    opensearch-creds   8m21s
----

When you see `True` in the READY column, it means the instance is provisioned and ready to use.

== Get the credentials to access the instance

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secrets opensearch-creds -o yaml
