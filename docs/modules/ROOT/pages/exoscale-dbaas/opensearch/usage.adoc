= Using an OpenSearch service

The YAML code below creates two objects: a `ExoscaleOpenSearch` service and a pod accessing it to show information about the service.
The latter references the `opensearch-creds` secret that will contain the access keys required to connect to the service.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: exoscale.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: ExoscaleOpenSearch
metadata:
  name: my-opensearch-example
  namespace: my-namespace

    service:
      zone: ch-dk-2

    size:
      plan: hobbyist-2
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:

apiVersion: v1

    command:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
    args:
      - curl "$OPENSEARCH_URI"
    envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: opensearch-creds # <2>
----
<1> The operator will create a secret with the access keys to connect to the instance.
<2> The pod will use the secret to connect to the instance.
