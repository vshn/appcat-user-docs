= Using a Kafka service

The YAML code below creates two objects: a `ExoscaleKafka` instance and a Pod accessing it to show information about the instance.
The latter references the `kafka-creds` secret that will contain the access keys required to connect to the instance.

NOTE: We provide a sample container that supports client side certificates and should work out of the box.
It will create a test topic and will continuously publish to and read from that topic.
Aiven has https://github.com/aiven/aiven-examples/tree/main/kafka[example code in multiple languages] that may help you to get started with your own application.

<1> The operator will create a secret with the access keys to connect to the instance.
<2> The pod and its volume will use the secret.
