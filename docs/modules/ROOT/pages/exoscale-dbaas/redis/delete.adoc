= Delete a Redis service

If you do not need a Redis service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete exoscaleredis my-redis-example
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `ExoscaleRedis` object from the cluster, it will be deleted together with all of its data!
