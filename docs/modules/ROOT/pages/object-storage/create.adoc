= Create an Object Storage Bucket

AppCat allows DevOps engineers to quickly provision https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3[Amazon S3^]-compatible Object Storage Buckets in various environments.

Apply the following object on your namespace, as specified by its YAML description.

.Example to create an Object Storage bucket
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: ObjectBucket
metadata:
  name: my-cool-bucket
  namespace: my-namespace # <1>
spec:
  parameters:
    bucketName: my-bucket-change-name # <2>
    region: rma # <3>
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: objectbucket-creds # <4>
----
<1> The namespace where the object will be created.
<2> The bucket name for this ObjectBucket. If not specified, a random name will be generated based on the claim name. So in this case the bucket name would look something like: `my-cool-bucket-xyz`
<3> The bucket's region depends on the selected Provider, see xref:references/cloud-zones.adoc#_regions[here] for more details
<4> Secret where the connection details are provisioned. This secret shouldn't exist at this time.
+
IMPORTANT: Object Storage Bucket names must be unique across providers. Make sure to choose a name with prefixes and other guards, to prevent any issue during the creation of the bucket. Check the status field of the `ObjectBucket` for such errors.

== Create a Bucket in another cloud provider

By default the bucket is created on the same cloud provider where the cluster is running on.
For instance, if you are on an Exoscale cluster, to create an ObjectBucket on cloudscale.ch add the following YAML snippet to the `spec` of an ObjectBucket:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  compositionRef:
    name: cloudscale.objectbuckets.appcat.vshn.io # <1>
  parameters:
    region: rma # <2>
----
<1> The reference name of the backing cloud provider, see xref:object-storage/references.adoc#_provider_references[here] for available references.
<2> Change the region identifier in accordance for the resp. cloud provider, see xref:references/cloud-zones.adoc#_regions[here] for more details.

[TIP]
====
This mechanism allows advanced deployment or failover scenarios.
For example, if your application is running on Exoscale, you can create a primary bucket on Exoscale and a secondary bucket on cloudscale.ch or vice versa.
Using a mirroring tool like https://rclone.org/[rclone] you can achieve bucket replication between different cloud providers.

. Get information about your new bucket object.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get objectbucket
NAME               READY   CONNECTION-SECRET    AGE
my-cool-bucket     True    objectbucket-creds   5s
----
+
If you see the "True" value in the READY column, it means that your bucket is provisioned and ready to use.
+
IMPORTANT: If your object bucket doesn't get the state ready after a while, try to delete the bucket and re-create it with a different name.

. Get the required secrets to use your bucket from other applications.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secrets objectbucket-creds -oyaml
----

Find the complete specification of the generated secret in the xref:object-storage/secrets.adoc[secrets page].

. Check the bucket status
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe objectbucket my-cool-bucket
Name:         my-cool-bucket
Namespace:    a-demo-project
