= Delete an Object Storage Bucket

If you do not need an Object Storage bucket anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete objectbucket my-bucket
----

== DeletionPolicy

By default, deleting the `ObjectBucket` will also recursively delete all objects within it and the bucket itself.

To prevent that, there's a `deletionPolicy` called `DeletIfEmpty`. As the name suggests, it will then only delete the bucket if it's empty. However, you will still lose access to the data. If you've deleted a bucket by mistake and had the `DeletIfEmpty` policy set, please contact support@vshn.ch and we will help you get your data back.

.Example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: ObjectBucket
metadata:
  name: my-cool-bucket
  namespace: my-cool-ns
spec:
  parameters:
    bucketName: my-bucket-change-name
    region: ch-gva-2
    bucketDeletionPolicy: DeleteIfEmpty
