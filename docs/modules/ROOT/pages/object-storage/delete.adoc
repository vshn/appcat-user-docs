= Delete an Object Storage Bucket

If you do not need an Object Storage bucket anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete objectbucket my-bucket
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `ObjectBucket` object from the cluster, it will delete the actual bucket including all stored objects in it as well (recursive delete)!
There will be a `DeletionPolicy` soon, that will provide accidental deletion protection.
