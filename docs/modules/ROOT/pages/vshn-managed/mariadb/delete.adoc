= Delete a MariaDB service

== Delete non protected MariaDB instance

If you do not need your MariaDB service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnmariadb.vshn.appcat.vshn.io mariadb-app1-prod
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `VSHNMariaDB` object from the cluster, it will be deleted together with all of its data!
