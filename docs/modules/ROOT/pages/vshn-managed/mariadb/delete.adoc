= Delete a MariaDB service

== Delete non protected MariaDB instance

If you do not need your MariaDB service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnmariadb.vshn.appcat.vshn.io mariadb-app1-prod
----

include::page$references/delete.adoc[tag=common]

== Delete protected MariaDB instance

A MariaDB instance that is protected from deletion cannot be deleted right away.
First disable deletion protection then delete the instance.

[source,bash]

$ oc edit vshnmariadb.vshn.appcat.vshn.io mariadb-app1-prod
