= Database Deletion Protection

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Deletion Protection feature is enabled by default and ensures backups are available for 7 days
after a database instance is deleted. Any backup available at the time of an instance deletion can be used
to restore data into a new instance. The Deletion Protection feature does not restore the deleted
database instance.
====

== Configuration

Deletion protection can be enabled or disabled and the retention period can be defined using the following configuration:
