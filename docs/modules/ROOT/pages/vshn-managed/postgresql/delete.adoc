= Delete a PostgreSQL service

If you do not need your PostgreSQL service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnpostgresqls.vshn.appcat.vshn.io my-postgres-example
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `VSHNPostgreSQL` object from the cluster, it will be deleted together with all of its data!
