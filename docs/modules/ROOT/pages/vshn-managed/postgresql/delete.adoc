= Delete a PostgreSQL service

== Delete non protected PostgreSQL instance

If you do not need your PostgreSQL service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnpostgresqls.vshn.appcat.vshn.io pgsql-app1-prod
----

include::page$references/delete.adoc[tag=common]

== Delete protected PostgreSQL instance

A PostgreSQL instance that is protected from deletion cannot be deleted right away.
First disable deletion protection then delete the instance.

. Disable deletion protection:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc edit vshnpostgresqls.vshn.appcat.vshn.io pgsql-app1-prod
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: VSHNPostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: pgsql-app1-prod
  namespace: prod-app
spec:
  parameters:
    security:
      deletionProtection: false # <1>
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: postgres-creds
----
<1> Make sure the parameter is set to false

. Delete the instance
+
