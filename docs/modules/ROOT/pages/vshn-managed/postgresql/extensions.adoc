= PostgreSQL Extensions

PostgreSQL supports many different extensions, such as https://postgis.net/[PostGIS^] or https://www.timescale.com/[TimescaleDB^].
These extensions can be used in PostgreSQL by VSHN as well.
For a list of all available extensions please https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/intro/extensions/[consult this page^].

== Enable PostgreSQL Extensions

To enable an extension, add the following configuration to your instance:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: VSHNPostgreSQL
metadata:
  name: pgsql-app1-prod
spec:
  parameters:
    service:
      extensions:
        - name: ltree <1>
----

<1> Name of the extension as found on the "Name" column at https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/intro/extensions/[the official listing^]. Add more extensions to the list as needed.
After applying the change, AppCat will ensure that the extension is available after a short while.

WARNING: Some extension like `timescaldb` or `postgis` will require a restart of the instance to be available.
Depending on your https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/postgresql/update-strategy.html[Instance Update Strategy], it's possible that the instance will restart immediately.
