= Delete a Nextcloud service

== Delete non protected Nextcloud instance

If you do not need your Nextcloud service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnnextcloud.vshn.appcat.vshn.io nextcloud-app1-prod
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `VSHNNextcloud` object from the cluster without having xref:vshn-managed/postgresql/deletion-protection.adoc[deletion-protection] enabled, the Nextcloud instance will be deleted together with all of its data and backups!
