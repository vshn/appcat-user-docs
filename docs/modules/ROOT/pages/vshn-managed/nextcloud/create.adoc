.Example to create a Nextcloud instance
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: VSHNNextcloud
metadata:
  name: nextcloud-app1-prod # <1>
  namespace: prod-app # <2>
spec:
  parameters:
    service:
      version: "23" # <3>
      useExternalPostgreSQL: true # <4>
      postgreSQLParameters: {} # <5>
    size: # <6>
      plan: standard-2
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: nextcloud-creds # <7>
----
<1> Instance name
<2> The namespace where the object will be created
<3> Nextcloud version
<4> If we should use the VSHNPostgreSQL as a database backend instead of the build-in SqLite database backend. (defaults to true)
<5> PostgreSQL database parameters. See xref:vshn-managed/postgresql/index.adoc[PostgreSQL by VSHN] (Only used when `useExternalPostgreSQL` is false)
<6> Size of the Nextcloud instance. See xref:vshn-managed/nextcloud/plans.adoc[Plans and Sizing] for more information.
<7> Secret where the connection details are provisioned. This secret shouldn't exist before creation.

NOTE: To get more information about all available configuration options, please see the xref:references/crds.adoc#k8s-api-github-com-vshn-component-appcat-apis-vshn-v1-vshnnextcloud[API Reference]

== Inspect your new Nextcloud service

[source,bash]
----
$  oc get vshnnextcloud.vshn.appcat.vshn.io
NAME                SYNCED   READY   CONNECTION-SECRET   AGE
nextcloud-app1-prod   True     True    nextcloud-creds       4m23s
----

When you see `True` in the READY column, it means the instance is provisioned but the pods might still be starting.
It may take some time for the instance to be available especially during the provisioning phase.

== Find the connection details

The connection details are stored in a secret. You can retrieve them with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secrets nextcloud-creds -o yaml
----

The output of the command above is a secret specification with the following structure:
