= Delete a Keycloak service

== Delete non protected Keycloak instance

If you do not need your Keycloak service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnkeycloak.vshn.appcat.vshn.io keycloak-app1-prod
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Non-reversible operation
====
If you delete the `VSHNKeycloak` object from the cluster without having xref:vshn-managed/postgresql/deletion-protection.adoc[deletion-protection] enabled, the Keycloak instance will be deleted together with all of its data and backups!
