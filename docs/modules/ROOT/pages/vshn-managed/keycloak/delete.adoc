= Delete a Keycloak service

== Delete non protected Keycloak instance

If you do not need your Keycloak service anymore, you can delete it in the same way as you would with any other object in your cluster:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete vshnkeycloak.vshn.appcat.vshn.io keycloak-app1-prod
----

include::page$references/delete.adoc[tag=common]

== Delete protected Keycloak instance

A Keycloak instance that is protected from deletion cannot be deleted right away.
First disable deletion protection then delete the instance.

. Disable deletion protection:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc edit vshnkeycloak.vshn.appcat.vshn.io keycloak-app1-prod
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: VSHNKeycloak
metadata:
  name: keycloak-app1-prod
  namespace: prod-app
spec:
  parameters:
    security:
      deletionProtection: false # <1>
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: keycloak-creds

. Delete the instance
