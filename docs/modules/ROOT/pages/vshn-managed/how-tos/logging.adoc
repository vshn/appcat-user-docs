= How-To Access Service Logs

NOTE: This page describes how to access the logs of a VSHN service deployed on https://docs.appuio.cloud/[APPUiO Cloud^].

== Via the Command Line [[viacli]]

Each service provided by VSHN is deployed in its own namespace.
The access to those namespaces is deliberately limited, for more information see xref:references/permissions.adoc[].

It is possible to list and view the logs of all pods in those namespaces.

.Get the instance namespaces for your services
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get <vshn-service> -o custom-columns="KIND":.kind,"NAME":.metadata.name,"INSTANCE NAMESPACE":.status.instanceNamespace <1>
KIND             NAME         INSTANCE NAMESPACE
VSHNRedis        app1-prod    vshn-redis-app1-prod-rt4w5
VSHNPostgreSQL   buzz         vshn-postgresql-buzz-qvgrd
----
<1> vshn-service can be any of vshnredis, vshnkeycloak, vshnmariadb, vshnpostgresql etc.

Once the instance namespace is identified, it's possible to list the pods within it, in this case all pods of our redis instance.

.List pods in the namespace
[source,bash]
----
oc -n vshn-redis-app1-prod-rt4w5 get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-0   1/1     Running   0          105m
----

After the correct pod has been found the logs can be shown as usual via the CLI.
For our example we look at the logs of the redis pod.

.Print redis logs
[source,bash]
----
oc -n vshn-redis-app1-prod-rt4w5 logs redis-master-0
1:C 17 Mar 2023 10:21:19.049 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
1:C 17 Mar 2023 10:21:19.049 # Redis version=7.0.9, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=1, just started
----

== Via Kibana

Please consult https://docs.appuio.cloud/user/how-to/access-logs-through-kibana.html[Access Logs Through Kibana] for general access to Kibana.

In order to show the logs of a VSHN services, you need to know first the namespace where it's deployed.
Please consult the <<viacli>> section for a how-to.

By default Kibana will show all logs available.
To limit it to the instance namespace use the filter `kubernetes.namespace_name` as shown on the images below.

. Add a filter to Kibana

. Then filter per namespace
+
image::namespacefilter.png[]

Afterwards Kibana will show all logs, filtered to the requested instance.
