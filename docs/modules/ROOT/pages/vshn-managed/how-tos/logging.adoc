= How-To Access Service Logs

== Via CLI [[viacli]]

Each service provided by VSHN is deployed in its own namespace.
The access to those namespaces is deliberately limited, for more information see xref:references/permissions.adoc[].

It is possible to list and view the logs of all pods in those namespaces.

.Get the instance namespaces
[source,bash]
----
kubectl  get vshnredis claim -ojsonpath="{.status.instanceNamespace}"
----

Once the instance namespace is identified, it's possible to list the pods within it.

.List pods in the namespace
[source,bash]
----
oc -n vshn-redis-app1-prod-rt4w5 get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-0   1/1     Running   0          105m
----

After the correct pod has been found the logs can be shown as usual via the CLI.

.Print redis logs
[source,bash]
----
oc -n vshn-redis-app1-prod-rt4w5 logs redis-master-0

1:C 17 Mar 2023 10:21:19.049 # Redis version=7.0.9, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=1, just started

== Via Kibana

Please consult https://docs.appuio.cloud/user/how-to/access-logs-through-kibana.html[Access Logs Through Kibana] for general access to Kibana.

In order to show the logs of a VSHN services, the namespace where it's deployed has to be determined first.
Please consult the <<viacli>> section for a how-to.

By default Kibana will show everything.
To limit it to the instance namespace add a filter `kubernetes.namespace_name`.

.Add a filter to Kibana

.Filter for namespace

Afterwards Kibana will show all logs for the given instance.
