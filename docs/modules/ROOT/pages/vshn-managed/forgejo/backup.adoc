= Backups

Backups are enabled by default. The Forgejo instance will be backed up daily at a randomly chosen time between 22:00 and 4:00.

You can specify a different backup time and interval using the following backup configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: vshn.appcat.vshn.io/v1
kind: VSHNForgejo
metadata:
  name: forgejo-app1-prod
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  parameters:
    ...
    backup:
      schedule: 0 22 * * * <1>
    ...
----
<1> The schedules for your backups.

== Contents

The backup relies on `forgejo dump` which collects all the data, including the database, into a single archive.  
Eseentially, it's a copy of the `/data` directory.
