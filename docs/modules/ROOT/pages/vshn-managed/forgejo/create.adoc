== Inspect your new Forgejo service

[source,bash]
----
$  oc get vshnforgejo.vshn.appcat.vshn.io
NAME                SYNCED   READY   CONNECTION-SECRET   AGE
forgejo-app1-prod   True     True    forgejo-creds       4m23s
----

When you see `True` in the READY column, it means the instance is provisioned but the pods might still be starting.
It may take some time for the instance to be available especially during the provisioning phase.

== Find the connection details

The connection details are stored in a secret. You can retrieve them with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get secrets forgejo-creds -o yaml
----

The output of the command above is a secret specification with the following structure:
