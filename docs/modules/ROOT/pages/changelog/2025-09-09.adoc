Are you wondering whatâ€™s new in AppCat?
Not much, besides everything!

== Production-ready Redis by VSHN

With release https://github.com/vshn/appcat/releases[v4.169.0], you can use https://products.vshn.ch/appcat/redis.html#_service_maturity[fully mature] and https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/redis/replicas.html[highly available] Redis by VSHN.
You can sleep soundly knowing that the monitoring and alerting will take care of the fuzz at night, if you have https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/redis/sla.html[updated your service level] to guaranteed availability.

== AppCat OpenShift templates

Have you already tried out the AppCat service templates on OpenShift marketplace?
You should. It is an easy way to https://docs.appcat.ch/getting-started.html#_via_openshift_console[get started] with the service.
Give it a try with our PostgreSQL by VSHN or MariaDB by VSHN.

== PostgreSQL by VSHN with CNPG

The latest addition to our offering is PostgreSQL by VSHN with CloudNativePG (CNPG).
It is very fresh from development and can already be provisioned. More features to come in the next sprints.
If you would like to learn more about why we decided to go with CNPG, https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/adr/0036-revisiting-postgresql-operators.html[here] are the insights into our operator evaluation.

== Nextcloud by VSHN

We found an error in an edge case for backup schedules during maintenance. The backups for all current instances were running. The edge case is now fixed. 
We also added a Security Context Constraint (SCC) that works with restricted-v2. 

== MariaDB by VSHN

https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/mariadb/troubleshooting.html#_sql_mode_contains_only_full_group_by[`SQL_MODE` settings] were sub-optimal and got well-deserved improvements.

== AppCat framework beyond Bitnami

Now that the storm has calmed and we have had the time to evaluate the tech landscape,
we have decided how to move forward with https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/adr/0038-appcat-redis-alternative.html[Redis by VSHN] and
https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/adr/0037-mariadb-bitnami-replacement.html[MariaDB by VSHN] without Bitnami and with the Open Source community.

For MariaDB, the official MariaDB operator ticks all the boxes, as for Redis DandyDeveloper redis-ha chart has the most promising potential.

Looks like we will be busy.
