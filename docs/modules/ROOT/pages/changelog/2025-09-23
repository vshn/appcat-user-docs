= Changelog 2025-09-23

Are costs important to you? If so, the release https://github.com/vshn/appcat/releases[v4.170.0] might be one that you want to pay attention to.

== Disable backups

To help keep the costs down, you can deactivate backups for your test environments. As an example, https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/postgresql/backup.html#_disable_backups[here] you can see how to deactivate backups for your PostgreSQL instances.
Yes, also for your production instances, but that is not something that we would advise. EVER.


== PostgreSQL by VSHN with CNPG

The latest addition to our offering is PostgreSQL by VSHN with CloudNativePG (CNPG).
It is very fresh from development and can already be provisioned if you follow the guide https://docs.appcat.ch/vshn-managed/postgresql/create.html#CloudNativePG[here].
More features like backups to follow in the next sprints.
If you would like to learn more about why we decided to go with CNPG, https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/adr/0036-revisiting-postgresql-operators.html[here] are the insights into our operator evaluation.

== AppCat Release Process

This one is more for us than you. Though useful for planning your updates.
We work in 2-week sprints. At the end of each sprint, we release a new AppCat version. The entire process is documented https://kb.vshn.ch/app-catalog/framework/runbooks/AppCatRelease.html[here].

== Nextcloud by VSHN removed hard-coded www-data

For Nextcloud the expectation is that the Cron jobs execute under the containerâ€™s configured runtime user or group. It should not be hard-coded to www-data.
Under a least-privilege SCC like restricted-v2, the cron process should not require additional capabilities.
