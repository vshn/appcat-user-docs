Are costs important to you? If so, the release https://github.com/vshn/appcat/releases[v4.170.0] might be one that you want to pay attention to.

Yes, also for your production instances, but that is not something that we would advise. EVER.


== PostgreSQL by VSHN with CNPG

The latest addition to our offering is PostgreSQL by VSHN with CloudNativePG (CNPG).
