= Usage with ArgoCD

In order for AppCat to work properly in conjecture with ArgoCD there are two requirements that need to be fullfilled:

* ArgoCD has to be at least v2.4.8
* The `ResourceTrackingMethod` needs to be set to `annotation`

== Workaround

If the requirements can't be satisfied, following workaround will help.
On any instance that should be managed by ArgoCD it will need following annotations:

[source,yaml]
----
annotations:
  argocd.argoproj.io/compare-options: IgnoreExtraneous
  argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: Prune=false
----

NOTE: With these annotations ArgoCD won't clean up left over objects.
So it might be possible that manual deletion is required if the instance is removed from ArgoCD.
