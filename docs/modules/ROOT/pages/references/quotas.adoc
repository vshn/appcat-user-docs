= Quotas on cloudscale.ch

The resource quotas are in place to protect the APPUiO Cloud cloudscale.ch cluster from abusive resource consumption.
You might be familiar with the https://docs.appuio.cloud/user/references/default-quota.html[APPUiO Cloud default quotas].
However, AppCat has slightly higher quotas than APPUiO Cloud's default:

* 4.5 CPU limits/requests
* 16.5 Gb Memory limits/requests

These are to ensure that the `standard-8` and `plus-8` plans of each service should at least be available with one replica (if the service provides support for that).

If you need an instance with more resources than the quotas allow, then initially create an instance with fewer resources. Afterward, open a ticket with VSHN support.
Be sure to mention the name of the instance in the support ticket, so that the support engineer can find it.
