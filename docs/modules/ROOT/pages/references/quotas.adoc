= Quotas on cloudscale.ch

To protect the APPUiO Cloud cloudscale.ch cluster from abusive resource consumption, there are some quotas in place.
You might be familiar with the https://docs.appuio.cloud/user/references/default-quota.html[APPUiO Cloud default quotas].
However AppCat has slightly higher quotas than APPUiO Cloud's default:

* 4.5 CPU limits/requests
* 16.5 Gb Memory limits/requests

These are to ensure that the `standard-8` and `plus-8` plans of each service should at least be available with one replica (if the service provides support for that).

If you need an instance with more resources than the quotas allow, then please create the instance initially with less resources and then open a ticket with the VSHN support.
Be sure to mention the name of the instance, so that the support engineer can find it.
